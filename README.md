The original Omnifood website was built as a final project for a Udemy course.
I didn't want to follow a tutorial and create the same exact thing so I did a full redesign of the original Omnifood website and all of its assets and created my very own version. 
Omnifood is a fictional company focused on providing AI-based meals through a subscription service.

# Key Features
Having created the website from scratch, I learned how to create and implement features that I'm likely to use in my future websites over and over again. Here are some of the key features and topics that I worked on:

- Took original assets and converted the color palette to my chosen colors
- Used Figma to build frames for each section
- Hamburger menu that appears on tablet-sized screens and smaller
- Smooth scrolling whenever any navigation (header and footer) are clicked
- Subtle animations that trigger when a certain viewport rule is met (e.g. element is in viewport or element is not in viewport) using `IntersectionObserver` 
- Added cross-broswer support for certain CSS styles using prefixes (`-webkit`, `-moz-`, `-o-`, `-ms-`)
- Tested website on different browsers & had to style the `select` input so that it appears the same on all browsers/devices
- Functional form with a message displayed after submission by user
- Toggle switch in pricing section that switches pricing from monthly to annual
- Fully responsive thanks to media queries
- Marquee animation in hero section using `@keyframes` and not the deprecated `<marquee>` tag
- Utilized grid, flexbox and absolute positioning
